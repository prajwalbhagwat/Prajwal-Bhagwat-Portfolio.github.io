Portfolio Website

Technology Used:
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript

Description:
This is a Front-end Portfolio Website which is interactive and responsive website.
The webpage consists of six main sections: Home, About, Services, Skills, Projects, and Contact. 
The navigation bar is always at the top of the viewport. You can click on links to navigate to different sections of the page.
I have also used effects like typing effect, carousel effect, etc.
I used media queries for mobile phones with smaller displays to adjust the webpage layout.
I used Visual Studio Code to write the code and GitHub to host the project.
